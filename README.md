# web-browser-lsp
A toy program that implements a text-based web browser as a language server.

## Motivation
My favorite progrmming tools are neovim, tmux on a fast terminal emulator and firefox. R.I.P. vimperator.
I've tried w3m, lynx, browsh, libsixel, vim-bind webextension, keyboard-driven browser, etc.
but I can't find anything that goes beyond vimerator.

## Features
There is no implementation

## Concept
* text-based web browser
* Using a full-featured browser
  - Connecting via Chrome DevTools Protocol
  - It's impossible to develop a full-featured browser by myself
* and Switchable
  - Non-textual rich contents may be required
